      "Important rules when creating the diagram:\n",
      "- Prefer using graph TB types of diagrams.\n",
      "- Avoid linear diagrams when possible, diagrams should be hierarchical and have multiple branches when applicable.\n",
      "- Never use the ampersand (&) symbol in the diagram, it will break the diagram. Use the word \"and\" instead. For example use \"User and Admin\" instead of \"User & Admin\".\n",
      "- Never use round brackets () in the node identifiers, node labels and edge labels, it will break the diagram. Use a coma instead. For example use \"User, Admin\" instead of \"User (Admin)\".\n",
      "- Don't use empty labels \"\" for edges, instead don't label the edge at all. For example U[\"User\"] --> A[\"Admin\"].\n",
      "- Don't add the label if its the same as the destination node.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rules when using graph diagrams:\n",
      "- Use short node identifiers, for example U for User or FS for File System.\n",
      "- Always use double quotes for node labels, for example U[\"User\"].\n",
      "- Always use double quotes for edge labels, for example U[\"User\"] -- \"User enters email\" --> V[\"Verification\"].\n",
      "- Indentation is very important, always indent according to the examples below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rules when using graph diagrams with subgraphs:\n",
      "Never refer to the subgraph root node from within the subgraph itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example this is wrong subgraph usage:\n",
      "```\n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this diagram M is referenced from within the M subgraph, this will break the diagram.\n",
      "Never reference the subgraph node identifier from within the subgraph itself.\n",
      "Instead move any edges that connect the subgraph with other nodes or subgraphs outside of the subgraph like so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Correct subgraph usage:\n",
      "```\n",
      "graph TB\n",
